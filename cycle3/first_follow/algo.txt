1. Input
- Read the number of productions n
- Read each production into prods[]

2. Compute FIRST sets
- For each non-terminal:
- If it’s already computed, skip.
- Otherwise:
  * For each production A → α
  * If α begins with a terminal, add it to FIRST(A)
  * If α begins with a non-terminal B, recursively find FIRST(B)
  * If B can derive ε (epsilon), continue to the next symbol
  * Store results in firsts[]

3. Compute FOLLOW sets
- For each non-terminal:
  *If it’s the start symbol, add $
  *For every production A → αBβ:
    *If β is a terminal, add β to FOLLOW(B)
    *If β is a non-terminal, add FIRST(β) except ε to FOLLOW(B)
    *If β → ε or B is at the end, add FOLLOW(A) to FOLLOW(B)
    *Store in follows[]

4. Display
- Print FIRST and FOLLOW sets for all non-terminals.
